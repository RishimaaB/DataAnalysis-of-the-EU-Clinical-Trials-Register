This would make it possible to monitor specific biomedical advancements, including whether they have domestic or foreign origins, the number of trialists in the nation and how active they are individually, the areas in which trials are being conducted, the institutions sponsoring the trials, their locations, and so forth.

In this work we have determined what steps it takes to identify all trials run in India, that are registered with EU CTR.
